## Finding optimal parameters for MACD 
## (Moving Average Convergence-Divergence) stock trading indicator
##
## BACKGROUND
## MACD (Moving Average Convergence-Divergence) stock trading indicator 
## is one of the ## popular technical oscillators/indicators that is often employed 
## to enter market for trading securities. Regularly recommended settings 
## use subtraction of the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 
## 12-day EMA (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp). 
##      In our R project, we studied a wide range of settings to evaluate financial 
## return of underlining security trading. We found that optimal settings vary 
## greatly between securities, and therefore length of the long and short EMA 
## waves need to be determined specifically for each security. When we model 
## international index trading, the cumulative financial return with optimal MACD
## parameters we found was always better than a conservative buy-and-hold 
## strategy.

## NOTE-1:  this code is designed and written by GitHub user “redsun123“
##                 exclusively for demonstrating of the programming automation
##                 capabilities.  Author of the code does not responsible for any 
##                 financial losses occurred, but is responsible solely for a profit.
##
## WORKFLOW
##   -- download international stock market indices
##   -- clean data
##   -- calculate exponential moving averages
##   -- calculate MACD and MACD-Histogram
##   -- generate signals to open position
##   -- emulate the closing of positions in several days and calculate return
##   -- vary length of the short (signal) and long waves
##   -- generate reports
##
## REPORTING and OUTPUT:
## REPORT-1: generate summary report (as a *.csv file) with all 
##                     analyzed indices and all returns for the entire time period 
##                     under investigation (approximately three calendar years)
## REPORT-2: generate heatmap (as a *.PDF file) for each index to 
##                     visualize the best combination of the short and long waves 
##                     to reach maximal return 
## REPORT-3: compare returns for each index assuming conservative 
##                     buy-and-hold strategy (single *.csv file) versus MACD with 
##                     optimal settings
##
## NOTE-1: Main code is in R language. The code invokes additional 
##                custom functions that are located in a source code in a 
##                separate file.
## NOTE-2: code requires configuration of working directory; 
##                code needs R environment; code.R file should be moved into 
##                working directory
## NOTE-3: REPORTs are located in the subdirectory "BGS_Cache"
